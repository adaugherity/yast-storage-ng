This is a technoligy preview to demonstrate:

- libstorage-bgl-eval supports:

  * filesystems on disks without a partition table

  * MD RAIDs can be changed to be partitioned or unpartitions on the fly

- use of libstorage-bgl-eval from Ruby/YaST without legacy code

The module is entirely unsupported.
