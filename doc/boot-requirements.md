## needed partitions in a PPC64 system
- in a non-PowerNV system (KVM/LPAR)
	- with a partitions-based proposal
		- if there are no PReP partitions
			- **requires only a PReP partition**
		- if the existent PReP partition is not in the target disk
			- **requires only a PReP partition**
		- if there is already a PReP partition in the disk
			- **does not require any particular volume**
	- with a LVM-based proposal
		- if there are no PReP partitions
			- **requires /boot and PReP partitions**
		- if the existent PReP partition is not in the target disk
			- **requires /boot and PReP partitions**
		- if there is already a PReP partition in the disk
			- **only requires a /boot partition**
- in bare metal (PowerNV)
	- with a partitions-based proposal
		- **does not require any particular volume**
	- with a LVM-based proposal
		- **requires only a /boot partition**
- when proposing a boot partition
	- **requires /boot to be ext4 with at least 100 MiB**
	- **requires /boot to be in the system disk out of LVM**
	- **recommends /boot to be 200 MiB**
- when proposing a PReP partition
	- **requires it to be between 256KiB and 8MiB, despite the alignment**
	- **recommends it to be 1 MiB**
	- **requires it to be out of LVM**
	- **requires it to be bootable (ms-dos partition table)**

## needed partitions in a S/390 system
- trying to install in a zfcp disk
	- with a partitions-based proposal
		- **requires only a /boot/zipl partition**
	- with a LVM-based proposal
		- **requires only a /boot/zipl partition**
- trying to install in a FBA DASD disk
	- **raises an error**
- trying to install in a (E)CKD DASD disk
	- if the disk is formatted as LDL
		- **raises an error**
	- if the disk is formatted as CDL
		- with a partitions-based proposal
			- **requires only a /boot/zipl partition**
		- with a LVM-based proposal
			- **requires only a /boot/zipl partition**
- when proposing a /boot/zipl partition
	- **requires /boot/zipl to be ext2 with at least 100 MiB**
	- **requires /boot/zipl to be in the system disk out of LVM**
	- **recommends /boot/zipl to be 200 MiB**

## needed partitions in a x86 system
- using UEFI
	- with a partitions-based proposal
		- if there are no EFI partitions
			- **requires only a new /boot/efi partition**
		- if there is already an EFI partition
			- **only requires to use the existing EFI partition**
	- with a LVM-based proposal
		- if there are no EFI partitions
			- **requires /boot and a new /boot/efi partition**
		- if there is already an EFI partition
			- **requires /boot and a reused /boot/efi partition**
- not using UEFI (legacy PC)
	- with an MS-DOS partition table
		- with sufficently large MBR gap
			- in a partitions-based proposal
				- **does not require any particular volume**
			- in a LVM-based proposal
				- **requires only a /boot partition**
		- with too small MBR gap
			- **raises an exception**
		- with no MBR gap
			- **raises an exception**
		- with GPT partition table
			- if there is no GRUB partition
				- in a partitions-based proposal
					- **only requires a new GRUB partition**
				- in a LVM-based proposal
					- **requires /boot and a GRUB partitions**
			- if there is already a GRUB partition
				- in a partitions-based proposal
					- **does not require any particular volume**
				- in a LVM-based proposal
					- **only requires a /boot partition**
	- when proposing a boot partition
		- **requires /boot to be ext4 with at least 100 MiB**
		- **requires /boot to be in the system disk out of LVM**
		- **recommends /boot to be 200 MiB**
	- when proposing an new EFI partition
		- **requires /boot/efi to be vfat with at least 33 MiB**
		- **requires /boot/efi to be out of LVM**
		- **recommends /boot/efi to be 500 MiB**
		- **requires /boot/efi to be close enough to the beginning of disk**
	- when proposing an new GRUB partition
		- **requires it to have the correct id**
		- **requires it to be out of LVM**
		- **requires it to be between 256KiB and 8MiB, despite the alignment**
		- **recommends it to be 1 MiB**
